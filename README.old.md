# movies-explorer-frontend

This is a 4th project from a [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/) web dev course. In this project I learn to do basic JavaScript and manipulate DOM. Use objects and event listeners to add cards, like/delete them and make modal windows with JS validation for them.

## My process

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Figma
- JavaScript Basics and DOM manipulation

### What I learned

I learned two ways to make a pop-up(modal) window.

1. Using an overlay and pop-up window `<div>`.
2. Using a `<dialog>` tag. It has good built-in features like `element.openModal()` JavaScript functions with "out of the box" overlay that can be accessed with `::backdrop` pseudo-class to tweak its color or opacity, for example. Sadly it's still [not supported](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog "CanIUse.com") everywhere.
3. How to delete remote branch. `git branch -d <branch name>` removes branch locally, But it stays on github. To see all branches type `git branch -a` for all or `-r` flag to see only remote. To delete remote branch `git push origin -d <branch name>`. [Source article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-delete-remote-branch).

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

[Typograph](https://www.artlebedev.ru/typograf/) helps to put normal quotes (“Christmas trees” and “paws”) instead of inch signs, kill extra spaces, change hyphens to dashes in the right places, “attach” all short conjunctions and prepositions to the words following them with an inseparable space and produce a bunch other operations.
